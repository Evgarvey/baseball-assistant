# README

This is a work-in-progress full-stack application running with a rails backend and a node.js frontend.
It is currently a proof of concept but the long-term aspirations for this project are to make it perform comparative statistics for UFC fighters.

Currently using the following libraries / frameworks:
- Ruby 3.2.2
- Rails 7.0.7.2
- Devise / Devise-jwt
- Some others TBD (not pushed yet, still on my laptop)

More information to come as this project matures!
